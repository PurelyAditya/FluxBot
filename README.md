How It Works
FluxBot uses the Google Gemini API to generate responses based on natural language input. The Assistant UI frontend facilitates communication by displaying both user inputs and bot responses in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Flow Overview:
User Input → Sent to Google Gemini API for processing.

Google Gemini → Analyzes the input and returns a response.

FluxBot UI → Displays the response to the user.

Customization
You can easily modify the settings of FluxBot to change how it interacts, the tone it uses, or even the types of responses it provides. Update these parameters in the config.js file.

Example customization:
javascript
Copy
Edit
module.exports = {
  botName: "FluxBot",
  responseTone: "friendly", // can be "formal", "friendly", "casual"
  maxResponseLength: 150,   // set maximum response length
};
